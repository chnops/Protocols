Total RNA Isolation with DNA co-elution from Soil
===========
Adopted from: MoBio PowerSoil RNA extraction kit and MoBio PowerSoil RNA extraction DNA-elution kit
-----------

-  DNA contamination can be removed from the total RNA samples by treating with Turbo DNA-free Kit.

-  Wear RNase-Free gloves (1555) at all times and remove RNase from the work area using Lab Cleaner (12095) for RNase Removal. Both of these products are available from MOBIO. Please see “Other Quality Products Available” section at the end of this manual.
    -  Alternatively, I constantly using eliminase and change my gloves to eliminate any DNAse/RNAse contamination.
    -  I also open any bottles, containers, tubes, reagents, etc. in the RNA hood ONLY!
    -  Always use FILTERED tips for any RNA extraction related reagents. 

-  **Detailed Protocol**
1. Add up to 2 g of frozen soil to the 15 ml Bead Tube (provided).  If soil is already aliquoted out in 15 mL conical tubes, the beads from the bead tubes can simply be poured into the conical tube.  Fear not, our mighty Corning brand conical tubes CAN handle the phenol:chloroform step.
    1. If samples are stored in MoBio LifeGuard, spin down the samples at 2500 X g for 10 minutes. Decant to remove the LifeGuard before proceed to step 2.  

2. Add 2.5 ml of Bead Solution to the Bead Tube and vortex to mix.

3. Add 0.25 ml of Solution SR1 to the Bead Tube and vortex to mix.

What’s happening: The Bead Solution is a buffer used to disperse cells and soil particles. Solution SR1contains SDS and other disruption agents which aid in complete cell lysis. In addition to aiding in cell lysis, SDS is an anionic detergent that breaks down fatty acids and lipids associated with the cell membrane of several organisms. Note: If it gets cold, it will form a white precipitate. Heating to 60ºC will dissolve the SDS and will not harm the other disruption agents.

4. Add 0.8 ml of Solution SR2 and place the Bead Tube on the Vortex Adapter (MO BIO Catalog #13000-V1-15 for Vortex Genie 2 or 13000-LV2-15 for Labnet Vortex) and vortex at maximum speed for 5 minutes.  The vortex adapter can bounce around a lot if its not balanced.  Dion wants you to stay and watch during the vortexing, and yes it can do tricks!  

What’s happening: Solution SR2 is a precipitation reagent used to remove non-DNA organic and inorganic material including humic substances, cell debris, and proteins. Contaminating organic and inorganic matter may reduce DNA purity and inhibit downstream DNA applications. Vortexing is critical for homogenization and cell lysis.

5. Remove the Bead Tube from the Vortex Adapter and add 3.5 ml of phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH 6.5 – 8.0, [User supplied]) and vortex to mix until the biphasic layer disappears.  Be very careful with the phenol:chloroform. Dion has a scar on his wrist from getting a single drop of it on his skin. All phenol:chloroform steps MUST be carried out in the hood when possible.  Be sure to wear a lab coat when working with phenol:chloroform and always use the glass pipettes.  

6. Place the Bead Tube on the Vortex Adapter and vortex at maximum speed for 10 minutes.  Again stay and watch, since the vortexing is taking place in the hood now you may need to watch it more carefully as there is less open space in the hood.

What’s happening: Cells are lysed by combination of chemical agents from steps 1-5 and the mechanical shaking introduced by vortexing. Phenol:chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol is added to maximize lysing efficiency and yield. Lysed cell components are trapped in the solvent and proteins are denatured leaving the nucleic acid in solution.  The MO BIO Vortex Adapter is designed to be a simple cost effective platform to facilitate the homogenization and cell lysis of samples. An alternative to the MO BIO Vortex Adapter would be to attach your tubes to your platform with tape. Note that tape can become loose and may result in uneven shaking
and lysis efficiency resulting in inconsistent results or lower yields.

7. Remove the Bead Tube from the Vortex Adapter and centrifuge at 2500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.

What’s happening: Centrifugation results in phase separation of the sample mixture. Three phases will be visible after centrifugation. The lower organic phase containing proteins and cellular debris, the interphase containing humics and other organic and non-organic material, and the upper aqueous phase containing total nucleic acid. Note: The thickness of the interphase will depend on the sample type. Samples high in organic content will have a thicker interphase.

8. Remove the Bead Tube from the centrifuge and carefully transfer the upper aqueous phase (avoiding the interphase and lower phenol layer) to a clean 15 ml Collection Tube (provided).  The thickness of the interphase will vary depending on the type of soil used. Discard the phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol in an approved waste receptacle. Note: The biphasic layer will be thick and firm in soils high in organic matter and may need to be pierced to remove the bottom phenol layer for disposal.

What’s happening: The upper aqueous phase containing the total nucleic acids from the sample is transferred to a new tube. Cellular debris, proteins, and organic material are left behind. Note: Take care not to transfer material from the lower phase or the interphase.

9. Add 1.5 ml of Solution SR3 to the aqueous phase and vortex to mix. Incubate at 4°C (on ice) for 10 minutes.  From this point on you may notice a distinct phenol smell…  I have tried many variations at step 7 to ensure complete removal of the phenol but I have never been able to get rid of the smell.  I called MoBio and spoke with an R and D person and they said that the smell was normal, I disagree but I haven’t been able to get rid of the smell.

What’s happening: Solution SR3 is a secondary precipitation step to further remove proteins and cellular debris.

10. Centrifuge at 2500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.

11. Transfer the supernatant, without disturbing the pellet, to a new 15 ml Collection Tube (provided).

What’s happening: The supernatant containing nucleic acids are transferred to a new 15 ml tube. Nonnucleic acid material is left behind.

12. Add 5 ml of Solution SR4 to the Collection Tube containing the supernatant, invert or vortex to mix, and incubate at -20°C for 30 minutes.
Note: For samples with high salt content, incubation in Solution SR4 at room temperature will result in higher RNA yields.  I would do this step at room temp all the time.  Before this “note” was added to the protocol the precipitate would be a large white pellet with a little brown spot or brown marbling.  Step 15 would take FOREVER!  If you do it at room temp there should be a small brown pellet only. 

13. Centrifuge at 2500 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature.

14. Decant the supernatant and invert the 15 ml Collection Tube on a paper towel for 5 minutes.  Note: Depending on soil type, the pellet may be large and/or dark in color.  Typically I see a phase separation at this point with an aqueous layer on top and a darker layer on the bottom.  Again the MoBio guys say this just happens… 

What’s happening: Solution SR4 is 100% Isopropanol. Nucleic acid is precipitated and the Isopropanol is discarded.

15. Shake Solution SR5 to mix. Add 1 ml of Solution SR5 to the 15 ml Collection Tube and resuspend the pellet completely. (Note: Depending on the soil type, the pellet may be difficult to resuspend. Resuspension may be aided by placing the tubes in a heat block or water bath at 45°C for 10 minutes, followed by vortexing. Repeat until the pellet is resuspended.)  This has always been a bit of a challenge, like I said doing step 12 at room temp helps.  I tend to hold the sample/s in my hand for a few minutes and then vortex on medium (Dion doesn’t want me to vortex at full speed) and then let the sample sit for a few minutes.  Rinse and repeat until the pellet has dissolved.  This typically takes about 30 minutes.  Dion doesn’t like their suggestion of using a water bath.

What’s happening: Solution SR5 is a proprietary salt solution used to resuspend the precipitated nucleic acids from step 14. It is also used to equilibrate the RNA capture column in step 16 and to wash and prep the column for the elution of RNA in step 20 below.

16. Prepare one RNA Capture Column (provided) for each RNA Isolation Sample:

a. Remove the cap of a 15 ml Collection Tube (provided) and place the RNA Capture Column inside the 15 ml Collection Tube. The column will hang in the 15 ml Collection Tube.

b. Add 2 ml of Solution SR5 to the RNA Capture Column and allow it to gravity flow
through the column and collect in the 15 ml Collection Tube. Allow Solution SR5 to
completely flow through the column (Optional: The Collection Tube may be emptied after Solution SR5 has completely flowed through the column. Note: DO NOT ALLOW THE COLUMN TO DRY OUT PRIOR TO LOADING THE RNA ISOLATION SAMPLE.)  I know its tempting but don’t start this until step 15 is done.  Step 15 takes a lot longer than 16b.

17. Add the RNA Isolation Sample from Step 15 onto the RNA Capture Column and allow it to gravity flow through the column. Collect the flow through in the 15 ml Collection Tube.

18. Wash the column with 1 ml of Solution SR5. Allow it to gravity flow and collect the flow through in the 15 ml Collection Tube.

What’s happening: The sample is added to the RNA Capture Column and the nucleic acids are bound to the column matrix. The Capture Column is then washed with a second volume of Solution SR5 to ensure unbound contaminants are removed from the sample and column prior to the elution of RNA.

19. Transfer the RNA Capture Column to a new 15 ml Collection Tube (provided). Shake Solution SR6 and then add 1 ml of Solution SR6 to the RNA Capture Column to elute the bound RNA into the 15 ml Collection Tube. Allow Solution SR6 to gravity flow into the 15 ml Collection Tube.

What’s happening: The Solution SR6 RNA elution buffer is a proprietary salt solution that allows for the preferential release of RNA from the RNA Capture Column leaving DNA, residual debris, and inhibiting substances in the column. 

20. Transfer the eluted RNA to a 2.2 ml Collection Tube (provided) and add 1 ml of Solution SR4.  Invert at least once to mix and incubate at -20°C for 10 minutes.

21. Centrifuge the 2.2 ml Collection Tube at 13,000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature to pellet the RNA.

22. Decant the supernatant and invert the 2.2 ml Collection Tube onto a paper towel for 10 minutes to air dry the pellet.
    - This is the perfect step to stop for the day. RNA sample is the most stable in the precipitated form under isopropanol/ethanol.  If you cannot get to quantitation or gel electrophoresis in the same day, stop right here!

What’s happening: Solution SR4 is 100% Isopropanol. Eluted RNA from the Capture Column is precipitated, centrifuged, and allowed to air dry prior to resuspending and concentrating.

23. Resuspend the RNA pellet in 100 μl of Solution SR7.

What’s happening: Solution SR7 is RNase/DNase-Free water used to resuspend the pelleted DNA.  Solution SR7 contains no EDTA. DNA is now ready for any downstream application. For long term storage of samples 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 or TE buffer may be used to resuspend the pelleted RNA. (Note: Although DNA carryover does not occur with the majority of soil types, certain soils high in organic matter may present unique carryover situations. In situations where the absence of DNA contamination is critical, the purified RNA should be tested for potential DNA carryover by performing  PCR with qualified primers on the isolated RNA without performing prior reverse transcription amplification. The absence of a detectable amplification fragment by agarose electrophoresis indicates the absence of detectable carryover DNA. In the event DNA is detected, DNase treatmentof the isolated RNA is recommended; see Additional Information Section for instruction).

Next you want to check the sample on an E-gel.  This will give you a rough idea of how much DNA contamination there is and indicate the quality of the RNA.  You may also want to check the sample concentration using the Nanodrop.
