Answer the following questions before you proceed:
----

1. Am I analyzing metagenomic data or gene targeted data?   
2. Which sequencing platform?  
3. Do I have a mapping file (i.e., barcodes/tags, primers, linkers, sample ID) for my gene targeted sequences?   
4. For my gene targetted sequences, do I know where barcodes are located? Do I know if my raw sequences contain primers and/or linkers?   
5. For my gene targetted sequences, do I know which sequence region I am using as the marker?  6. Do I have pair-ended sequences?   
7. Are the maker genes I am going to analyze full length or partial?

**If you cannot answer or your answer is no** to the questions above, please contact the person who processed the samples and/or the sequencing facility. These questions are critical to raw sequence processing.
