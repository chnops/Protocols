Subsample peat (stored at +4ºC until all subsampled)
==============

+  **Ingrowth Peat**  
    1. One subsample for determining gravimetric soil moisture  
        1. \>15 g/sample or however much can be packed into the pre-weighted aluminum trays   
            1. the more sample the better   
            2. peat (especially fresh peat) contains ~90% of water   
        2. Dried peat can be stored in coin bags   
        3. Part of the dried peats can be used to determine soil pH (per location, per geography)   
    2. One subsample for microbial biomass analysis
        1. See sequential extraction protocol  
        1. Directly subsample into 50ml conical tubes, record the exact weight!   
        2. 8.1 ± 0.1 g    
    3. One subsample for DNA extraction   
        1. In Whirl Pack
        2. 20-30 g/sample
        3. Store at -80ºC
    4. One subsample for Ergosterol analysis
	1. In Whirl Pack
        2. 15-20 g/sample
	3. Store at -20ºC
    5. One subsample for soil enzyme analysis
	1. In Whirl Pack
	2. 10-15 g/sample
	3. Store at -20ºC
    6. Archive samples
	1. In Whirl Pack
	2. Should have />10g left
